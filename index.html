                    <p><h3>Project Prompt:</h3> Re-evaluate the MSGC website to improve the general user experience and bring it into compliance with WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines.</p>

                    <img id = "msgclogo" src = "images/logo-smaller.png">

                    <br><p><h3>Context:</h3> The Michigan Space Grant Consortium is in charge of disbursing grants 
                        for space-related research and activities to students, academics, researchers and more 
                        in the state of Michigan. These grants sponsor anything from sending important experiments 
                        into space, to creating technologies on Earth that will improve future space exploration 
                        ventures, and even public advocacy for space exploration and research. Through my research, 
                        I learned that their website is the place where government agencies dispersing funds, 
                        individuals and organizations looking to acquire those funds, and interested private 
                        contractors intersect.</p>

                    <br><p><h3>Process:</h3> As my process for this project, I used a few different methods: 
                        <strong>a full heuristic evaluation of the site, interviews, surveys, and an affinity wall,</strong>
                        which I compiled into the final deliverable for this internship, my <strong>final report</strong>.
                    
                        While I went into this project expecting to help execute a full re-design of this organization's
                        website, I quickly remembered after sinking my teeth into this project that design is all
                        about what people need you to make, not what you want to make. 

                        What I did know is that I had to get to learning much more about web accessibility if I was 
                        going to help bring this website up to modern accessibility standards, so that learning was
                        among the first things I did to get ideas about the changes I could make.</p>

                        <img class = "accessibilitypic" src = "images/accessibilitynotes.PNG">

                        <p>Wordpress plugins galore, oh my!</p>
                    </div>

                    <br><p><h3>Deliverables: </h3>After speaking with my supervisor and understanding the boundaries of this project, I worked 
                        to find a solution to their web accessibility issues within the WordPress platform they were using.
                        I recommended a series of plug-ins that collectively reached most of the WCAG 2.0 AA standards, 
                        and most of the remaining requirements we were able to reach through subtle changes to the site's design,
                        such as underlining key links.
                    </p>

                    <br><p>The heuristic evaluation of the site was one of the first exercises I chose to do after helping to 
                        improve web accessibility, so I could get ideas for how to improve the website and get a better 
                        understanding of the current state of affairs. This also helped me generate better questions for 
                    the interviews I would later facilitate.</p>

                        <p>Then came the interviews and surveys. Here are some of the opinions I got from interview participants, aggregated in the form of an affinity wall.

                            The main takeaways from these activities was that interviewees generally appreciated the site's look and feel,
                            but, while they also recognized there really wasn't anywhere else to go to get the things they needed
                            from this site and this organization, they still needed more information in key areas of the site.

                    <br><p class = "Whoops, let's save this for the reflection portion!"><h3>Reflections:</h3>
                        Working with people who were all in some way involved with academia and/or an educator themselves
                        was interesting, and an experience I had never had before in a UX context! Everyone I spoke with was both very kind but also keen on helping to improve things so that
                        this organization that they had all either benefited from or worked with could be its best self.
                        They were very much an audience who was well aware of the value of UX work and how its positive impacts
                        can be particuarly effective in helping even more people interact with this organization. 
                    
                        I was brought on as an intern with the MSGC team with these two goals in mind, of improving the site's
                        web accessibility and also its general usability/user experience. While I don't think I got to do everything
                        I wanted to during this UX adventure, I was glad for the research experience it gave me, as research, done right, 
                        is the most important component of design.</p>
                    
                    <!-- <br><p id = "text1">Project Overview: Over the summer as a portfolio project, I decided to more significantly flesh out a task management app I had been dreaming of for some time, making a mobile interface for a back-end I have been writing in Python. In contrast to other task management apps, Pyet focuses on the ever-changing importance of your tasks in a given moment, alleviating the mental math of constantly re-evaluating the most important thing to be doing in any given moment.
                    <br><br>
                    Outcome: I created a prototype of the app, what it would look like, and its functionality. The main app view visualizes tasks as bands on a streamgraph-like visualization, being wider or narrower based on their importance at a given point in time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Context: I outlined the prototype for Pyet on paper and tidied it up in Figma. I created this app over the course of about three weeks in the summer, as well as about three more weeks of working on the back-end of the app and designing how it would function during the holidays of December 2020 - January 2021. This project was entirely of my own creation.
                    <br><br>
                    Process Overview: For Pyet, I chose not to conduct an entire cycle of user research and product design. This was partially because I had completed two almost entirely research-based projects prior to my work on Pyet, but also because it was a personal project, and I wanted to have some fun designing an app for myself primarily. <a href = "https://github.com/rosellij/Task-Management-App/blob/main/panicCalendarUMSI.py">I coded the back-end first as that was the skillset at the time.</a> I did it a bit haphazardly, figuring out the logic of it as I went, but eventually ended up with something coherent: a system similar to a favorite app of mine, Todoist, where users can just input task-related info, and an algorithm will determine what type of data each piece of that input is, as well as what the actual data from each piece should be (I am well aware this isn’t best design practice, to do back-end work first, but I didn’t know at the time I was going to even continue work on this concept! I never thought I’d end up expanding a free-time project from six months prior into a whole entry in my portfolio!). From there, I built out the app’s front-end as I went, and it was a fun ride!
                    <br><br>
                    Problem Statement: My problem for Pyet was a personal one: I become stressed when I see all the tasks on my to-do list, and I also become stressed trying to figure out which ones are most important at any given moment.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Iterative Research: While I didn’t do a formal competitive analysis for Pyet, I did poke around with some casual research to make sure I wasn’t building something that already existed, and to make sure that there was no alternative that I would prefer over building my own app! The closest alternative I found was Todoist, from which I took a cues on how to input tasks (I love how flexible they make it for their users!) and, while Todoist and other apps have task prioritization systems, they often feel more like an afterthought (simply another 1-4 tag you can give a task, rather than something that dynamically and realistically reacts to several factors). I also did not make formal user flow outlines or personas, rather building the flow into the app as I was building it and using myself and my needs/tendencies in place of a persona, because I am building this for me! While I let myself “treat myself” with this project, having myself be the user-in-mind, I do believe in and recognize that we, as designers, should always be focusing on the end user and their needs/wants rather than projecting our own, just wanted to make that clear!
                    <br><br></p>

                    <p><br>
                    Iterative Design: I always knew the “streamgraph” task view was going to be the focal point of this app. Through iteration, I added a few more key elements and ideas to the app, such as vertical lines behind the streamgraph representing dates, a view where you can overlay an integrated calendar to easily compare task importance with how much time you have to really complete those important tasks, and an easy way to edit task importance (simply press and hold!). My user testing for this was modest, just me going through the app and its flows, since this was a personal project for fun.
                    <br><br>
                    Reflections/Takeaways/Impact: This project was great for me to get a foothold in Figma, a platform I ended up using often throughout this past semester. I had dabbled in Figma, but never created a full prototype in it before. The prototype is not interactive/functional, which is one thing I hope to improve about it one day (maybe remaking it in Framer!). Making this prototype also helped me understand, especially while talking to my UX designer peers about it, that I don’t need to necessarily flesh out the entire app in the prototype, that sometimes UX deliverables are asked to be more of an overview than a complete app.

In response, we created an app that both streamlines the process of deciding on/scheduling fun social activities with your friends and encourages trying out more adventurous social activities.</p><div class = "sideblurb"><img src = "images/Logo (1).svg"><p>Our logo!</p></div>
                    <p><br>
                    Outcome: We created a functional app prototype and ranked best in our category (“Activity Apps”).
                    <br><br>
                    Context: We created this app over the course of five weeks as a team in a design competition. We used the Google Suite for brainstorming, recording interview data, and other organization; the final prototype was created in Figma. I was one of five team members and was the de facto Design Lead (I worked alongside three business majors and a computer science major!).
                    <br><br></p><div class = "sideblurb"><img src = "images/BestInCategory.jpeg"><p>There's us at the top!</p></div>
                    <p>Contributions: The competition had two main parts: design a digital product that addresses the competition prompt, and pitch it to a panel of judges with a fully fleshed out business plan. While I helped a bit with the business model side of things, I focused primarily on creating our functional prototype, and coordinated work from the other team members towards creating that (none of them had designed a digital product before!).
                    <br><br>
                    Process Overview: Due to the very limited timeframe of the competition, we had to start bold by simply brainstorming product ideas, and then getting user interviews going to validate that idea (I mention this point as I know it is bad design practice, to design without proper context, but we had little choice, and did the best we could. Turns out we did pretty alright!). Brainstorming and user interviews (a non-mandatory step I encouraged our team to do) came along with personas and a user flow model, and were followed by a wireframe and then a full digital prototype in Figma. 
                    <br><br></p><div class = "sideblurb"><img src = "images/TheTeam.jpeg"><p>The Team!</p></div>
                    <p>Problem: Some people have a hard time maintaining consistent relationships with other people they care about and/or making new relationships with other interesting people. The pandemic only made this more of an issue, due to the logistic and social changes it brought (that are still very much present, even today). Our research showed us that this problem is still a problem for some people, just maybe not as many as we initially thought, which helped us decide to double-down on target demographics rather than going for a more generic approach.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Iterative Research: In our brief competitive analysis, we determined that our niche was unique enough that we could carve out a slice of it, especially if we partnered with local business and featured unique things-to-do opportunities for different areas. We made a couple personas and corresponding journey maps as well, as part of the competition’s requirements.
                    <br><br></p>
                    <iframe id = "iframe4" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FWx7WuErKO2INvJsdFpHsad%2FWireframe%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p><br>
                    Iterative Design: While we didn’t have time for external user testing, we did review the design internally with our team and worked to pair down the interactions to the minimum necessary to facilitate the product’s design objectives. We cut out one or two entire views from the main app flow of finding an activity to do and didn’t lose any major functionality in the process. We thankfully took enough care with our wireframing that we were able to move quickly on to a hi-fi prototype with minimal functional changes and mostly just the necessary aesthetic improvements.
                    <br><br>
                    Reflections/Takeaways/Impact: I had never been the lead design person on a team before, not considering that this was a small team and that I was more thrust into being a design lead rather than being appointed one. I suddenly found myself in a place where we needed to not only sync ideas and trains of thought for design decisions but also help teach my team members how to help implement those design decisions in Figma. I did what I could given the resources I had, yet ultimately I couldn’t help my teammates much. This experience did really make me realize how important it is for anyone working at any point of the product design process, especially on a small scale. It became abundantly clear to me on this project how bad it was that all of us had been living in a vacuum in our own fields; on small teams like these, everyone needs to be able to interact, at least a little bit, with everyone else and their work.

                    <br><br>
                    Outcome: We made a functional and fleshed-out app prototype for our product-concept. 
                    <br><br>
                    Context: This project was completed over the course of an entire semester (14 weeks), and we did most of our designing work in Figma, but compiled information and brainstormed using the Google Suite, and took video using iOS-based devices. I was one of five team members.

                    <p>Contributions: On this project, we generally split all work evenly throughout. In terms of research, for instance, we all often did a fifth: interviewing two people each for a total of ten; each writing one section of a paper report each for a total of five. Aside from that, I was gifted with the inspiration for the color palette (along with the help of the Figma Palette plug-in), created most of the profile section, was in charge of refining and standardizing the animations and elements used for our final prototype (such as creating interactive components from shapes), and helped out other people on minor aspects of other work as needed. My team members were wonderful and we often did great amounts of work on this project in our free time for fun (this also led to increased ambiguity as to who did what!).

                    <p>Process Overview: For this project, we went through the entire user research and design process, although, due to the class’s schedule, our user research process was abbreviated and bare-bones. We spent a week or so brainstorming, conducted one set of user interviews and two sets of user testing (once with our paper prototype and once with our digital prototype), made a set of personas, a style/brand guide, and more. This has been the most comprehensive and significant user experience project I’ve undertaken to date.

                    <p>Problem: The problem we wanted to address related to the prompt was intergenerational gratitude; we wanted to see if there was a way for us to increase how much intergenerational gratitude is expressed with our skills as user experience designers. We knew gratitude can only be expressed through communication, and communication can only happen with connection, so we decided to provide the connection. The next big hurdle to supporting intergenerational gratitude and its necessary connections was getting users on both ends of that connection: making a platform amenable to both elderly and young people.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Iterative Research: In our competitive analysis, we identified that there were people who did similar things to what we did, but couldn’t find anybody marketing a family communications app such as this one. We made a couple personas, including our lovely Linda and Brian, and wrote a little bit about how they might be interacting with our platform. In our interview and testing stages, we always strived to get a mix of age demographics, and we achieved that fairly successfully, with many grandparents interviewed in the end as well as some of the many college-age folks in great supply here and even a few middle-aged subjects.

                    <p><br>Iterative Design: Our two rounds of testing with our paper and digital prototypes, thankfully, only ran into fairly minor, easily corrected issues, with many issues both times simply being due to the limitations of paper and Figma-based prototypes respectively. We took our feedback in stride to make a better product!
                    <br><br>
                    Reflections/Takeaways/Impact: This was my first big user experience project working alongside a decent sized team. Other than frustrations from our platform of choice (curse you, limited Figma animations and interactions!), I realized once I was in the thick of things that I had expected this group work thing to be easier than it actually was! I was quickly and constantly reminded that, no matter how clearly I thought we had all communicated our ideas, we could always be a bit more precise! Especially since I was the person cleaning up the prototype in the end, it was clear that we could’ve better standardized animations and interactive components to save all that work I had to do in the end!

                    <br><p><h3>Context:</h3>This project, I completed as part of both my classwork (for SI 422: UX Research Methods) and a non-paid position (ICC Member Assistant) I was working in at the time. 
                    SI 422 assigned me with the first prompt, of creating a small body of research (as a project to, in a more hands-on way, learn about UX Research). With my goals at my position
                    with the ICC being a bit more free-form at the time, I decided to fulfill two needs at once by using the ICC website as my project focus.
                    
                    <br><br>The ICC is a student cooperative housing organization based out of Ann Arbor, MI, and can trace back its roots as part of the student community there to 1932. The ICC has a mission of being an inclusive and affordable living option for Ann Arbor students and citizens, an especially poignant mission in this time of rapidly increasing economic inequality and student debts.
                    The ICC's website features nearly an incredible wealth of information to users, on nearly every relevant subject imaginable for members, staff, non-members and more.</p>

                    <br><p><h3>Process:</h3>As part of this body of research, I conducted <strong>an anonymous user test of the ICC website</strong> through usertesting.com, 
                    as well as <strong>a series of interviews with test participants</strong> in the site's target student demographic and <strong>a survey of current ICC members</strong> to
                    gain an understanding of how the site was working for both prospective and current members, as it is designed to meet the informational needs of both.
                
                    <br><br>Due in part to the wacky interactions between the class and my ICC work, I ended up doing the interviews first, followed by the anonymous user testing and then the survey.
                    It was super fun to use the user testing software and see the perspectives people had from a few different continents on both the website's design and the idea of cooperative living.</p>

                    <br><p><h3>Deliverables:</h3>This project was a little bit less self-directed than my other projects so far, and as such I had my work cut out for me.
                    In addition to the research, however, I did have a little time to make a quick wireframe based on the findings from my research,
                    and also the opportunity to present my final presentation to the ICC's Director of Communications, all of which definitely made the experience worth it.
                    I'm definitely looking to be primarily a UX designer moreso than a researcher, but doing research-based projects like this one and my work for MSGC
                    not only allowed me to refine my skills in research and learn from the mistakes I made, but also olidified my belief that research is the most important part of the design process.
                
                    <br><br>My user interviews showed a few different key findings, some of the main ones included below:</p>

                    <br><p>beep</p>

                    <br><p>Text about the user testing I did, and the results thereof.</p>

                    <br><div>
                        <p>After going through the data from the interviews, testing, and surveys, it became clear to me that users visit this site for one primary reason: to acquire or reacquire housing.
                        In order to facilitate that goal, I knew the website would have to be streamlined, with the action of obtaining housing clearly highlighted as the main action of the site.
                        The current website has a navbar at the top with several main options; on the mainpage, I forewent this to have only a few large key buttons in the bottom-middle of the page, so that the user can "catch a vibe" of the organization from a nice splash image on the main page but also get right down to business.
                        Based on user feedback that the system of acquiring housing throug the site has often felt unintuitive and roundabout, I revised that flow to have a much clearer directionality, and the ability for users to skip the sections to learn about ICC housing if they're simply here to reapply.
                        The current sections for maintenance and other information on the site are sprawling; in this revision, I've fit them under their own neat roofs, clearly separate from and secondary to the housing acquisition flow. 
                        </p>

                        <p>While I haven't finished this wireframe yet, I intend to come back to it one day, maybe next summer, molding it into a site even more reflective of 
                        the beautiful people's project that is the ICC (and even better serving the people whose project it is!).</p>

                    <br><p><h3>Reflections:</h3></p>This project was particularly interesting as I was balancing both my class requirements and the needs of the ICC in my work.
                    Thankfully, they didn't prove to be too much in conflict, but, in retrospect, I'm glad to have gained experience in working with two sets of requirements from two different "supervisors."

    Ideas for the future:

    Parallax product prototype stuff/images and some
    text in between? all in the same color background maybe?

    got da logo, might be emoji time?
