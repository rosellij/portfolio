        <p>Hello! My name is John Garces Roselli, and this is my
            portfolio site!

            Currently, I am a student at both the School of Information
            and the School of Music at the University of Michigan,
            studying Information (User Experience concentration) and
            Multidisciplinary Studies (with Trombone as a primary instrument)
            respectively.<br><br>

            I am from Charlotte, North Carolina.<br><br>

            I am currently 21 years old! That's crazy!<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>I do some other neat things outside of UX Design and playing
            trombone! I've helped teach other students Python, helped lay
            the groundwork for a massive music education program in Detroit,
            been a driver for a driverless bus with an XBox controller, made some
            neat cross-disciplinary avant-garde performance art, lived in Gibraltar, UK,
            and have been able to go to a whole bunch of crazy different places!<br><br>

            Ask me about any of it, honestly! I hope hearing about some of my
            crazy life bits inspires you to reflect on and talk about your crazy
            life bits! I'd love to hear about 'em sometime!<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>I go to the University of Michigan, and I study UX design there! It's pretty neat!</p>
