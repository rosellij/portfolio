            <p>Hello! My name is John Garces Roselli, and this is my
                portfolio site!

                Currently, I am a student at both the School of Information
                and the School of Music at the University of Michigan,
                studying Information (User Experience concentration) and
                Multidisciplinary Studies (with Trombone as a primary instrument)
                respectively.<br><br>

                I am from Charlotte, North Carolina, and I am currently 21 years old! That's crazy!
            </p>
            <br><p>I do some other neat things outside of UX Design and playing
                trombone! I've helped teach other students Python, helped lay
                the groundwork for a massive music education program in Detroit,
                been a driver for a driverless bus with an XBox controller, made some
                neat cross-disciplinary avant-garde performance art, lived in Gibraltar, UK,
                and have been able to go to a whole bunch of crazy different places!<br><br>

                Aside from all that craziness, I love to cook; recently, I've been perfecting my
                recipes for Rigatoni Buttera and Detroit Style Pizza. I love cooking as, just like
                with music, it gives me an outlet to share something I love, something joyous
                with the people I care about. I am, first and foremost, a people-driven person,
                and I look forward to bringing that human-centered attitude to the classroom
                and the workplace every day.<br><br>

                Ask me about any of it, honestly! I hope hearing about some of my
                crazy life bits inspires you to reflect on and talk about your crazy
                life bits! I'd love to hear about 'em sometime!<br><br>
